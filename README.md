# Bug Score Calculator

## Overview
The Bug Score Calculator is a tool I created to replace our Excel based calculator with additional functionality and quality of life improvements.

## Main Features
- Calculates a bug score based on a questionairre (customer impact, workarounds, customer type, churn risk, and urgency). 
- Provides a priority rating (Trivial, Minor, Major, Critical/Blocker) based on the calculated score.
- Allows for easy input of relevant bug information.
- Generates a summary of the bug details and score for easy sharing to the ticket's description using click-to-copy functionality.
- Monthly to Annual ARR conversion (Opening the calculator app AND Excel just adds insult to injury).
- Auto Light/Dark mode based on system settings.

## How It Works
1. Team members input basic information about the bug (customer name, plan, monthly ARR, etc.)
2. The app presents a series of questions about the bug's impact and urgency.
3. Based on the answers, the app calculates a score and determines the bug's priority.
4. A summary is generated, which can be easily copied and shared in the ticket description.
