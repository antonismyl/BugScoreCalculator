# Bug Score Calculator

## Overview
The Bug Score Calculator is a tool I created to replace our Excel-based calculator with additional functionality and quality-of-life improvements.

## Main Features
- Calculates a bug score based on a questionnaire (customer impact, workarounds, customer type, churn risk, and urgency), but instead of typing a letter, you just check a box 🤯. 
- Provides a priority rating (Trivial, Minor, Major, Critical/Blocker) based on the calculated score (No more jumping between Excel and Confluence for 2 weeks after you get back from PTO to see what score corresponds with which priority (╯‵□′)╯︵┻━┻).
- Allows for easy input of relevant bug information (👉ﾟヮﾟ)👉.
- Generates a summary of the bug details and score for easy sharing in the ticket's description using click-to-copy functionality ヾ(⌐■_■)ノ♪.
- Monthly to Annual ARR conversion (Opening the calculator app AND Excel just adds insult to injury) (∩^o^)⊃━☆.
- Auto Light/Dark mode based on system settings (Searing your eyeballs is a choice now) 😎.

## How It Works
1. Team members input basic information about the bug (customer name, plan, monthly ARR, etc.)
2. The app presents a series of questions about the bug's impact and urgency.
3. Based on the answers, the app calculates a score and determines the bug's priority.
4. A summary is generated, which can be easily copied and shared in the ticket description.
